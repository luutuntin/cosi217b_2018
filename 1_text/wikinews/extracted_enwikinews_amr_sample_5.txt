Palestinians to elect new president on January 9
Palestine

RAMALLAH

Acting president Rawhi Fattuh has announced today that Palestinian elections will be held on January 9.
Futtuh, head of the Palestinian parliament, was sworn in hours after the death of Yasser Arafat on Thursday, and Palestinian Basic Law dictates that he may only serve up to two months before elections are held.

New leadership could prove to be the key to revitalizing the peace process in the Middle East, as both Israel and the United States had refused to work with Arafat.

The ''Haaretz had initially reported that former prime minister Mahmoud Abbas was selected by the Fatah central committee as their candidate for president, but Abbas has denied this, saying, "the matter is still being discussed.
" There have also been conflicting reports on whether or not jailed Palestinian leader Marwan Barghouti will run.

Barghouti is currently serving five life sentences in Israel for attacks against Israelis.
Nonetheless, he remains a popular figure among Palestinians for his role in the Palestinian uprising, and could potentially win the election if he decided to run.

A win by Barghouti could put Israel in an awkward spot; however an Israeli official said this week that he would not be freed, and a landslide win by Barghouti would signify to them that the Palestinians were not yet ready for peace.

Iran close to decision on nuclear program

Iran nuclear program
Iranian representatives say negotiations with Europe on its nuclear program are in the final stages.

Iran's foreign minister, Kamal Kharazi, told state television Saturday Iranian negotiators have given their final response to a European Union proposal to suspend Iran's uranium enrichment program.
He said it is now up to the Europeans to decide whether or not to accept their decision.

Iran and the European Union's big three powers — Britain, Germany, and France — have been negotiating a deal under which Tehran would agree to freeze sensitive nuclear work to avoid possible U.N. Security Council sanctions.

U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, says that Iran's nuclear program is intended to make nuclear weapons.
Iran authorities have insisted that their nuclear ambitions are limited to generating electricity from atomic energy plants, not making bombs. 

Critics of the position of the United States point to Israel's nuclear program.
Israel maintains a policy of nuclear ambiguity, but is widely believed to possess at least 82 nuclear weapons.
The program has not been condemned by the United States.
