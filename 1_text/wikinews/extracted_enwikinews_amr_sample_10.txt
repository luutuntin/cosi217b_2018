Palestinians to elect new president on January 9
Palestine
November 14, 2004
RAMALLAH

Acting president Rawhi Fattuh has announced today that Palestinian elections will be held on January 9.
Futtuh, head of the Palestinian parliament, was sworn in hours after the death of Yasser Arafat on Thursday, and Palestinian Basic Law dictates that he may only serve up to two months before elections are held.

New leadership could prove to be the key to revitalizing the peace process in the Middle East, as both Israel and the United States had refused to work with Arafat.

The ''Haaretz had initially reported that former prime minister Mahmoud Abbas was selected by the Fatah central committee as their candidate for president, but Abbas has denied this, saying, "the matter is still being discussed.
" There have also been conflicting reports on whether or not jailed Palestinian leader Marwan Barghouti will run.

Barghouti is currently serving five life sentences in Israel for attacks against Israelis.
Nonetheless, he remains a popular figure among Palestinians for his role in the Palestinian uprising, and could potentially win the election if he decided to run.

A win by Barghouti could put Israel in an awkward spot; however an Israeli official said this week that he would not be freed, and a landslide win by Barghouti would signify to them that the Palestinians were not yet ready for peace.

Iran close to decision on nuclear program

Iran nuclear program
Iranian representatives say negotiations with Europe on its nuclear program are in the final stages.

Iran's foreign minister, Kamal Kharazi, told state television Saturday Iranian negotiators have given their final response to a European Union proposal to suspend Iran's uranium enrichment program.
He said it is now up to the Europeans to decide whether or not to accept their decision.

Iran and the European Union's big three powers — Britain, Germany, and France — have been negotiating a deal under which Tehran would agree to freeze sensitive nuclear work to avoid possible U.N. Security Council sanctions.

U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, says that Iran's nuclear program is intended to make nuclear weapons.
Iran authorities have insisted that their nuclear ambitions are limited to generating electricity from atomic energy plants, not making bombs. 

Critics of the position of the United States point to Israel's nuclear program.
Israel maintains a policy of nuclear ambiguity, but is widely believed to possess at least 82 nuclear weapons.
The program has not been condemned by the United States.

Iran Agrees to Suspend Uranium Conversion
Iran nuclear program
November 15, 2004
TEHRAN

Hassan Rowhani, head of the Supreme National Security Council for Iran, announced Monday that the country would temporarily suspend conversion of uranium as of November 22.  
"Iran is planning to suspend uranium conversion activities from November 22," Rowhani said during a news conference.

Uranium is a chemical element which can be used in nuclear weapons and nuclear power plants.  
The process of conversion modifies the uranium oxydes into uranium hexafluoride.  
The purpose of such a conversion process is usually an intermediate step in the production of nuclear fuel.
Uranium hexafluoride cannot itself be used in a nuclear weapon, but can be enriched into weapons-grade uranium, or it can be converted into plutonium in a nuclear reactor.
Iran has claimed to be using its nuclear program for only peaceful nuclear energy, rather than for nuclear weapons, but there are concerns in the European Union and the USA as to whether they are being truthful.

Disasters and accidents
November 15, 2004

AUSTRALIA

128 people have been injured, 5 seriously so, in a high-speed train derailment in central Queensland.
Police said the tilt train came off the tracks near Bundaberg (about 400 kilometers north of Brisbane) at 12.06am AEST.

Queensland Transport Minister Paul Lucas visited the site, and reported that the black box recording device on board the train would be sent back to Brisbane for analysis, in order to determine the cause of the accident.

Premier Peter Beattie and Queensland Rail CEO Bob Scheuber said that there were no current plans to halt other tilt train services.  
"That will depend entirely on the investigators, they've not made any recommendations yet — some of them are still arriving.  
If they recommend that that is the course of action, then of course it would be suspended," Mr Beattie was quoted as saying.

Saddam Hussein profited roughly 1B by taking funds from UN program
Iraq
November 17, 2004
WASHINGTON

Investigators said that Saddam Hussein diverted money from the Oil-for-Food Program to pay millions of dollars to families of suicide bombers from the West Bank and Gaza Strip who carried out attacks on Israeli civilians.

Paul Volcker, a former American official investigating the diverted funds scandal, has taken some heat from advocates demanding that he haul United Nations personnel before the US Congress.
His reason for not subjecting them to this degree of open scrutiny is that it would have the perverse effect of pushing them into refusing to cooperate with the investigation at all.
He plans to release documentary evidence early next year, when his investigation is complete.
